						<h2>Design brief</h2>
					</header>
					<div class="image round left">

					</div>
					<p>Sydney is riddled with issues that have adversely affected the functioning and inherent value of the city itself. One of the largest issues that is affecting Sydney is the over consumption of electricity and inadvertently the exponential increase in the price of energy. Additionally, this is causing an increase in pollution and a tainted environment.</p>
					<p>In response to these issues, the ‘Hanakotoba’ or Language of the Flowers is a contemporary office building that, is entirely self-sufficient, renewable and sustainable. Through the implementation of the principle, biomimicry, large flower-like structures are attached to the exterior façade and the apex of the structure mimicking a plants photosynthetic function. Hence, providing energy for the building itself and the precinct it surrounds. Furthermore, the edifice will contain a green wall in an effort to absorb CO2 emissions and will also contain an in-built water tank system which will provide clean water for all facilities within the office building and surrounding area.

						<h2>Precedents</h2>
					</header>
					<div class="image round right">
						<img src="images/siemens.jpg"/>
					</div><p>The headquarters for Siemen’s new office complex was a source of major inspiration as it was a standout for sustainable design within an urban context. It has been planned as to generate an optimal life-expectancy, energy efficient and state-of-the-art facility which still provides a healthy working environment. This has been implemented into the final design as it formulated our intentions, that being, to construct a building which reduces Australia’s carbon foot print, is sustainable and self-sufficient.</p>
					<div class="image round left">
						<img src="images/heliotropism.jpg"/>
					</div>
					<p>Another form of inspiration comes from the mechanism in many plants known as Heliotropism. Plants that are known to contain this  feature include young sunflowers and bindweed. Heliotropism is the function where flower heads follow the sun in order to maximise the amount of absorbed sunlight for photosynthesis. This notion of following the sun to maximise energy output was a critical factor that has been implemented into this form of office building as it would allow for the largest and most efficient production of solar energy.</p>
					<div class="image round right">
						<img src="images/taisei.jpg"/>
					</div><p>The Taisei zero-energy building in Yokohama was also another source of inspiration. The building makes up for all their power consumption through conservation and the generation of their own power from solar panels around the building. The construct is also said to cut energy down to a quarter of that used by conventionally powered buildings of similar capacities. This was an inspiring form of architecture and the notions of a ‘zero-energy building’ have been re-imagined and improved upon in the design’s heavy concentration of floral like structures which mimic a plants photosynthetic function through solar panels.</p>
