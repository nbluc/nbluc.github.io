						<h2>Hanakotoba's Design</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The office building, Hanakotoba encompasses 40 floors in total, 37 of which are business floors, a board room, a high-end restaurant and the foyer/entry into the building. Floral forms on the side of the structure follow the sunlight through travelling on the edifices exterior spiralled railing to maximise the solar panels exposure to sunlight thus maximising the energy output.  The inside of this same spiralled railing is lined with a ‘green wall’ which contains an assortment of hardy medium density bushes which last all year round and are minimal maintenance. The larger form located at the top of the structure sits in one place. Whilst functioning as large solar panels for the generation of solar  energy, it also functions as a water collection construct, directing the flow of water to the centre of the structure where it flows down through the central column and to a water tank system.</p>
					<p>The use of oversized glass panes and polished concrete pillars allow for the building to fit within its urban context. As well as organic and natural forms; to smoothen the transition between urban to natural within the buildings heavily industrialised context, a mixture of oak and bamboo has been used for the flooring and marble for the detailing of the central column to further emphasise this transition. In the future, it is hoped that this design and/or its functionality will re-write the current strategies for office complexes as its far more efficient, sustainable, environmentally beneficial in the long run and will reduce Australia’s carbon foot print drastically. </p>
					<p>The implementation of several of these structures throughout Sydney would prove to be highly beneficial to not only Australia’s economy and energy efficiency of both commercial and residential groups but also to the environment. This is due to its ability to not consume energy from the grid and at the same time also generate a large reserve of renewable solar energy which can be fed back into the grid. Furthermore, the water tanks reservoir is large enough to aptly provide water to the employees through the buildings facilities and also discharge water through drip irrigation to the green wall, ensuring it remains healthy.</p>
					<p>With cafés located at the foyer and a high-end restaurant located on its top floor, the Hanakotoba also emphasises a communal space where not only employers may congregate, but also students and families, offering them a brief respite and a chance to indulge within the provided services. The large open planned office setting encourages communal projects and interactivity, creating a safe and collaborative working environment. Additionally, with the implementation of a glass wall façade, natural light permeates the structure, allowing for natural lighting for a majority of the day and also a chance for the workers to connect with the environment whilst in an office space.</p>
